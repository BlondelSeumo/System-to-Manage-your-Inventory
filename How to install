WHAT IS INVENTORY SYSTEM?

Inventory Management Systems is a key instrument for businesses when tracking their inventory. Typically,
Inventory Management Systems are used by firms that either sell a product or manufacture a product for
purposes of accounting for all the tangible goods that allow for a sale of a finished product, or parts for
making a product. The size and volume of a firm help dictate whether or not a firm is in need of such a
system as they can be quite extensive and costly. Large firms that have thousands of components must have
a system in place for the primary objective of tracking their assets.
